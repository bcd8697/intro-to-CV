## Overview
The goal of the homework is to count scores for the Ticket to Ride Europe boardgame. 

During the game, players connect different cities to complete some destination tickets. Every player has a set of train markers for claiming a route. 
At the end of the game, players got scores for claimed every route (=path between two neighboring cities) depending on its length:

(left - the number of markers, right - the score). A full version of the rules can be found here (Links to an external site.).

The goal is to create a system to count these scores automatically.
